# üß¨ DNA Sequence Analyzer Using Python

A simple Python-based bioinformatics project that analyzes DNA sequences. Ideal for BTech Biotechnology students who want to learn how to integrate biology with programming.

---

## üìå Project Objective

To build a Python program that:
- Counts the number of nucleotides (A, T, G, C)
- Calculates GC content of a DNA sequence
- Transcribes DNA into RNA
- Produces the reverse complement of the DNA strand

## ‚úÖ Project Code

```python
# DNA Sequence Analyzer

# Step 1: Define DNA sequence
sequence = "ATGCGTAACCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGGCTAATCG"

# Step 2: Nucleotide Count
counts = {"A": 0, "T": 0, "G": 0, "C": 0}
for nucleotide in sequence:
    if nucleotide in counts:
        counts[nucleotide] += 1

print("\n--- Nucleotide Count ---")
for base, count in counts.items():
    print(f"{base}: {count}")

# Step 3: GC Content Calculation
gc_content = (counts["G"] + counts["C"]) / len(sequence) * 100
print(f"\nGC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")

# Step 4: Transcription (DNA to RNA)
rna = sequence.replace("T", "U")
print(f"\n--- Transcribed RNA ---\n{rna}")

# Step 5: Reverse Complement
complement = {"A": "T", "T": "A", "G": "C", "C": "G"}
reverse_comp = "".join(complement[base] for base in reversed(sequence))
print(f"\n--- Reverse Complement ---\n{reverse_comp}")


---

üì• Sample Output

--- Nucleotide Count ---
A: 7
T: 7
G: 8
C: 8

GC Content: 51.43%

--- Transcribed RNA ---
AUGCGUAACCGUAGCUAGCUAGCUAGGCUAAUCG

--- Reverse Complement ---
CGATTAGCCTAGCTAGCTAGCTACGGTTACGCAT


---

üß™ Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: DNA sequence is written directly inside the code

Step 2: Count A, T, G, C using dictionary

Step 3: Calculate GC content as a percentage

Step 4: Replace T with U for transcription to RNA

Step 5: Reverse and complement the sequence
